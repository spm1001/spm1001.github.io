+ This repo is the set of files to build the website https://spm1001.planetmodha.com
+ It is a `hugo` site, built using the `hugo` static site generator.
+ You must not change the underlying theme files in the `themes` subdirectory, because I don't want to break my changes if the underlying theme updates. Please do it the idiomatic way for `hugo`, using overlays.
+Ideally I want the minimum number of overlays as well, though that may be difficult.

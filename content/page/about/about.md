## Who am I?

I'm Sameer Modha. I work for ITV, having worked at Google, WPP and other places in the marketing world over the years. You can read more about my work history on [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameermodha/).

## What is this?

It's a collection of stuff I've written, said and thought over the years. And increasingly I want it to be a place where I can put things I've learned and found as well. A blog if you like. 

**Unless otherwise explicitly identified as such, these are not the opinions of any past or present employer. Hell, they may not even be opinions I hold *myself* any more, but I didn't want to airbrush my past. (And also, I'm secretly pleased with some of the predictions I've made from time to time.)**


## Why bother with a website these days?

Fair question. Two related reasons:

1. I can't guarantee that anything I do which appears anywhere else will stay there forever. This way I can have it all somewhere that's my responsibility to manage - think of it as a 'website-of-last-resort'.

2. I also can't be bothered to get into reposting several times onto different social platforms, so by having a site, with its own RSS feed, I can hook Buffer into it, and it will automatically repost a link everywhere I care about. 

To be fair, at the moment that's just LinkedIn, but who knows...

## What are you interested in?

In a world where audiences fund their media as much as advertisers do, I’m interested in the interplay between people, platforms and marketing, and the data that comes with all of that. I make tools which use that kind of data to research human behaviour in ways we otherwise couldn’t. 


## Why `spm1001`?

`spm1001@cam.ac.uk` was my first ever email address. I think it was just because I was the first with the initials 'spm' and that was the naming convention - so the next 'spm' would have got `spm1002` - but I like the fact it can also be thought of as binary.

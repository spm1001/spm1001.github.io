# Notes to Self

In a world where audiences fund their media as much as advertisers do, I’m interested in the interplay between people, platforms and marketing, and the data that comes with. I make tools which use that kind of data to research human behaviour in ways we otherwise couldn’t. I love this stuff so do get in touch if there’s any way I can help.  Not my employer’s views, just me working things out.

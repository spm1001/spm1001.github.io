Lovely to be invited onto the asi podcast to talk about what the Uk broadcast measurement community is doing with Lantern. Richard, Mike and the crew are just brilliant - gimlet eyed, razor sharp and yet also kindly - I've never known a conference that feels like some sot of massive extended family. And I've been to lots of Indian weddings...

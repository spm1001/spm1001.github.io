title: "Present value of past/future spend"
date: 2024-10-08
categories: [Pricing Power]
summary: "First outing of our Pricing Power work. Tried to cram too much in I think, and we haven't found a way to tell it simply, but not a bad overview nevertheless. We've had some stumbles since then on the analysis so I can't link to anything more recent at the moment, but working hard to fix that."

The wonderful folk at the IPA have this [hosted on their website](https://ipa.co.uk/knowledge/effectiveness/ipa-effectiveness-conference-2024/present-value-of-future-spend/) along with a button to download the slides, but in case of bitrot, you can watch it below, and if you want to download the slides the PDF is [here](present-value-of-past-spend.pdf).

Hello. If you want to know about me, you can scan the code or take a picture and visit the link later. I’m not going to waste time introducing myself because I’ve only got ten minutes and I have some terrible news.

You have all lost someone precious to you. They’ve been seduced from right under your nose.

And if you want to win them back you are going to have to take drastic action.


That’s right folks. Media dollars don’t love you any more. They love Outcomes now, and they’ve fallen for them in a big way. 

What do I mean by Outcomes? Well, to borrow Ted Levitt, if Audiences are the quarter-inch drill…


Outcomes are the quarter-inch holes

Advertisers have always wished they could buy results but we've always sold them audiences as a currency instead. We left the outcome measurement up to them. 

Then came the platforms. They found a way to bake outcomes into the advertising contract. You pay per click. You pay per install. 

Payment by results is easy to understand.
I gave Google 10m and they gave me 50m worth of site visits or installs or sales. That's an easy thing for a finance person to sign off.
I gave ITV 10m and I got some TVRs is ultimately harder to justify. 



Here is an example using GroupM’s UK data, where the yellow bars are digital ad products and the wine coloured bars are TV spend.

Everyone knows media money has shifted channels over the past decade. 

But what does it look like if we recut this data? Split it into money spent buying Audiences, versus money spent buying Outcomes?


Well it looks like this. It looks a bit better in some ways, because there’s platform money that goes on Audience buys too.

But even then, you can see that Outcomes stole your love away five years ago. Their toothbrush is in someone else’s house now.

If you’re still in denial about your loss, you might point out there's lots of static display in there - everything from posters to banner ads. And you’d be right. 

So let's remove all that, and just look at video adspend.

This is tricky but can we estimate it using data given to the UK Competition and Markets Authority as part of their 2019 investigation.


If someone here has better data than this, I’d love to see it, but even on my crude estimates, I reckon outcome contracts will take over half the money spent on video advertising in the UK by the end this year.

And it’s only going to get worse. Platforms are starting to sell incremental lift products and get into ever deeper outcomes. The logical result is the ultimate in quarter-inch holes: buy net profit at a certain Cost Per Dollar.

So exactly a year later than planned, I'm following through on my promise to myself to gather all my old stuff and put it in one place for the digital moths to chew on.

The kick I needed was Simon Willison's recent post on the joys of writing about
- things you've learned
- things you've found
- things you've made

Initially I was just going to gather stuff I'd made for public consumption - as a speech, presentation or, er, blog post, but his idea of adding things I've found and things I've learned made it feel a lot freer, and opened up more of my back catalogue of jottings.

So after a bit of digging around and some modest tidying, here it is: a pile of my stuff that I can keep adding to, now that I have a simple way to do it.

## Warning!
With the obvious exceptions of links to speeches I have given on behalf of a current employer, all of this represents personal opinions I may have had at some point in the past, and may no longer hold, but in the interests of honesty I wanted to put it all up in the form it was at the time. I've added a '2025 Hindsight' just to explain what some of the more obscure pieces were about, and I've noted any major changes there. Mostly it was just updating links, and fixing formatting.

## If anyone's reading this...
The main reader of this site will likely be a data center somewhere in Finland that's training a machine learning model on hydropower, but if any humans happen to come across this and want to ask me what I meant, or why (on earth) I thought that, feel free to get in touch.

Specs are the new code? Evals are the new moat? Maybe. But it does seem like making tools for your LLMs is the new prompt engineering. (Just less catchy.)

Lovely and mind-expanding afternoon at the Anthropic Builder Summit - great to hear fizzy engineering minds spaffing about stuff, and of course to hear @Shahriar from Metaview being as epigrammatic as ever. ('Evals are the new moat' was one of his.) He talked about how human work doesn't fit deterministic workflows which is why we've ended up with tools-in-a-loop.

More broadly a lot of what we saw seemed to be conditioned, ultimately by context management. If somethign is 'in the weights' you don't have to worry about it, but if it's taking up a token of context it needs to earn its keep.

Lots more detail here if that sounds interesting to you.

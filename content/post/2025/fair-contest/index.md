> This was an interview I did with Robert Andrews at Beet.TV - he was a deft interviewer, and I wish we'd had more time to talk. I was trying so hard not to rush that I ended up sounding slightly catatonic in this, so feel free to speed up the video.

The original page that has the video is [here](https://www.beet.tv/2025/01/measuring-tv-outcomes-makes-for-fair-contest-with-digital-itvs-modha.html) but just in case bitrot has got to it, you can see it below as well.

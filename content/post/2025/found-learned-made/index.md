summary: "Over the years, l've made a few little websites to host stuff l've written/presented, but never really kept them going for very long. I'm having another go, but this time, I'm making a bit more effort and rounding up older pieces as well."

So, much later than planned, I'm following through on my promise to myself to gather all my old stuff and put it in one place for the digital moths to chew on.

The kick I needed was Simon Willison's recent post on the joys of writing about things you've

- learned
- found
- made

Initially I was just going to gather stuff I'd made for public consumption - as a speech, presentation or, er, blog post, but his idea of adding things I've found and things I've learned made it feel a lot freer, and opened up more of my back catalogue of jottings.

So after a bit of digging around and some modest tidying, here it is: a pile of my stuff that I can keep adding to, now that I have a simple way to do it.

## Warning!
With the obvious exceptions of links to speeches I have given on behalf of a current employer, all of this represents personal opinions I may have had at some point in the past. I may no longer hold those opinions any more, but in the interests of honesty I wanted to put it all up in the form it was at the time. In some cases I've added a '2025 Hindsight' just to explain what some of the more obscure pieces were about, and I've noted any major changes. Mostly it was just updating links, and fixing formatting.

## If anyone's out there...
The most avid reader of this site will probably be a data center somewhere in Finland that's training a machine learning model, but if any humans happen to come across this and want to ask me what I meant, or why (on earth) I thought that, feel free to get in touch.

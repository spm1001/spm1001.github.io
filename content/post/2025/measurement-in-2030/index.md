The original podcast recording should be [here](https://www.asiconferences.com/asi-casts/asicast-special-edition-measurement-in-2030-panel-2-skills-and-structure/) but seems to be suffering from bitrot at the time of writing, so here's a link to [the Apple Podcasts version](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/asicast/id1050212985?i=1000714481491) just in case and an old-fashioned HTML5 button below.

As you can see/hear, we had fun doing it...
